This project is a **Store Recommendation System** with analytics and interactive maps.  
It uses store location, category, ratings, and number of reviews to provide recommendations.

## Features

1. **Data Analytics & Visualization**

   - Number of stores by category
   - Average rating by store type
   - Rating vs Number of Reviews scatter
   - Top-rated stores

2. **KMeans Clustering**
   - Cluster stores based on geographic location
   - Visualize clusters in a scatter plot and interactive map

3. **Nearest Store Recommendation**
   - Find the nearest stores to any location
   - Distance calculated using Haversine formula
   - Display recommended stores on an interactive map

4. **Content-Based Filtering**
   - Recommend top stores of a specific type
   - Display them on a map
